# Frontal

> An Angular select/dropdown component

## Example

A couple of implementations can be found on [StackBlitz][stackblitz-example].

## Inspiration

* [This talk][compound-components] about compound components by [Ryan Florence][ryan-florence]
* The [Downshift][downshift] library

By taking in all this information, I wondered how this would look like in Angular.
